This website builds on the shoulders of giants. I am especially grateful to:

* Harald J. van Heerde, and his tutorial on “how to publish” (presentation at ANZMAC
Doctoral Colloquium, 2010)
* Jacqueline van Beuningen (who came up with a PhD Survival Guide, in 2009)
* Thesis skills, developed by Jan Meyer (Tecnologica de Monterrey, Mexico) and Anne
Klesse (Rotterdam School of Management, both 2010), and Johannes Bögershausen (developed in 2012)
