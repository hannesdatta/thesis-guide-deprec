# Expectations



* Be active and prepared
* If you are supervised in a team, please send your material to each other early enough,
  so that you can<br> (a) study each otherâ€™s work, and provide <br>(b) a round of feedback
  before submitting material to your supervisor
* Make appointments (well) in advance
* If you experience any kind of problem, let me know so that we can find a solution
* Individual meetings are possible (but, typically not at the beginning of your thesis
  trajectory, max. 3)
