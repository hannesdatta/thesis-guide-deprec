# SManaging me (i.e., your advisor)

* Be critical and take responsibility
    * This is your project, not mine! Even if I gave you some data,
      and even if you are working on topics related to my own research interest...
* Prepare thoroughly for meetings
    * Have an agenda of things you need to discuss
    * Send stuff early enough to allow me to prepare
    * Not only come up with problems, but also with solutions
* During our meetings
    * Don’t take criticism personally (I’m just trying to improve your work)
    * If you don’t know the answer to a question on the spot, say that you need time to
    think about it
* Keep me up-to-date
    * Provide a small recap of your project regularly



## The Dont's
* Don’t stay away for many weeks without informing me
* Don’t contact me for every tiny question you have, but first try to find a solution yourself or
  in discussions with your thesis partner
* Don’t plagiarize


## The do’s
* Do make an appointment before you come see me

* Do send me a reminder if I do not reply to your
  email <ins>within three working days</ins>
* Do submit things on time and stick to agreements
* Do take into account my agenda
* Do accept my feedback, but also give your feedback
  to me (!)
* Do write code/syntax (e.g., in SPSS, R)
* Write short and to the point emails
* If you call me (e.g., Skype/Hangouts), be prepared
  to share your screen. I prefer also talking with a
  webcam. And btw, please test your audio, too!



# Keeping your sanity 
* Follow your own pace: don’t compare to others
* Don’t think you haven’t done anything
* Realize that ups and downs are inevitable
    * E.g., questionnaires, data preparation and analysis
* Do things not related to your thesis
* It’s good to be ambitious (I am, too!), but realize that your thesis
  most likely will not change the world
* Talk to other students of mine / form groups
