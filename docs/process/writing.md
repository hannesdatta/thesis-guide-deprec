# Write actively, and engage your readership
* Write in active voice (as if you’re having a conversation with a good academic friend)
    * **Example 1**
         * Wrong: “The data has been analyzed and the following results found”
         * Correct: “We analyze the data, and find that [...]”
    * **Example 2**
         * Wrong: “three constructs have been combined”
         * Correct: “we combine three constructs”

* Use the collective “we” (or “I”)
    * Don’t be shy! Either use “I” or the collective “we” this will help you to tell a better story, and also avoid writing in passive voice.

* Avoid writing in “constructs”, but give meaning to everything you say
    * Wrong: “The overall click through rate for users in the “promotion” condition is [...]”
    * Correct: “Promotion focused users had higher click through rates than [...]”

# Avoid typos and grammar mistakes

**Some students seemingly have established a dangerous mindset about the details…**
* “Missing, incomplete or wrong references are okay in a master
* “Punctuation is no big
* “Grammar issues can be addressed
* “Details in figures and tables are only relevant in the final version of the thesis.”
* “The listed maximum length of a thesis is really only a rough guideline; it is okay if the manuscript is    actually longer.”


## **<ins>Recommendations:</ins>**
* Pay attention to the small details; do not allow issues with the details to get in the way of an           otherwise good thesis.
* Ask friends and fellow students for feedback & proof reading! Do so many times!
* Refer to the ‘”Academic’s Little Helper” <ins>[tiu.nu/writing]()</ins> and my own papers, available on      my website <ins>[dattaonline.com]()</ins> and my Tilburg profile <ins>[tiu.nu/datta]()</ins>
* If writing remains an issue for you, please be in touch with the Scriptorium they can help you greatly!


# Imitate a style
* Imitate a style of writing (e.g., from my own papers, or
the style of any of your favourite authors in your field
of research).
* A “paper format” (like you find in the journals)
overrules the ‘traditional’ thesis format as
communicated in the Master thesis guide by our
department.
