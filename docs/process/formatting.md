# Formatting your document

* **Format of your thesis**
    * A4, <ins>1.5 spaced</ins>
    * Times New Roman, 12pt.
    * Tables in 8pt or 10pt. Footnotes in 10pt. No exception. No fancy title pages.
* **Use page numbers (bottom right)**
    * same font as your text, 10pt
    * page numbers start with 1 on the first page after your title page (the title page doesn’t have any    page number)
* **Adhere to the English way of formatting numbers**
    * Decimal points , not commas (e.g., the average is 10.52, and not
    * Separation of groups of digits (e.g., there are 1,531 users in the data set, and not 1531; similarly, there are 1,531,213 song plays, instead of 1531213 song plays)
    * Drop leading zeros (e.g., .15 instead of 0.15)
* **Take time to proof read your thesis** 

# Table and figure formatting

* Tables need to be formatted yourself, e.g., in Word or Excel,
* You are not allowed to just paste the output from your statistical program in the main
  text (in the Appendix, it’s ok!)
* Tables (and also figures) should be understandable without reading the
  corresponding sections (i.e., use clear titles, and <ins>add notes</ins> wherever necessary)
* Note that you can also combine tables into larger ones, and thereby save space (e.g.,
  tables with the same explanatory variables but different coefficients)
* Avoid colors (also in figures!) - I’ll print your thesis in greyscale most of the time.
