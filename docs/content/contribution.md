# Making a contribution
![](/assets/contribution_content.png)

!!! quote
    The important issue is not how <ins>__many__</ins> contributions a study will make, but rather a <ins>__significance__</ins> for each.

<br/>

* **Test the assumptions**
    * … on which a significant stream of research relies

    * Taking a step back and identify core assumptions

* Probe the external validity
    * … of what we take to be true
    * Common background factors?

* The next new thing
    * Open new domains of inquiry
    * Make sure that this domain has significant implications if it was better understood

* Work backward in the causal chain
   * Examine a variable, that if understood better, 
      has major implications for a vast nest of relationships

* Intervene in an accepted causal chain
    * Taken-for-granted relationships? But really, really? What happens if they disappear?

* Challenging conventional managerial practices/beliefs

* Resolve inconsistent findings
    * Requires taking a step back…
    * Examine a stream of research in a holistic fashion
    * Focus on subtleties, that may have not so subtle implications


## Do you have a contribution?!

### Three questions-pitch
* Answer the following three questions about your research.
    1. What’s new about it? <br/> • E.g., new data? new variables? new<br/>method? 
    2. Is it useful (and to whom?)
    3. Is it interesting? 
        * Simply telling something everyone knows already isn’t interesting (known facts ≠ interesting)
        * Phenomenon, Gap, Aha!
        * Would you get your friends excited about it?!


### Elevator pitch
*   Imagine yourself going in the elevator and meeting
    the Rector of Tilburg University, who asks you to tell
    him what your MSc research is about…
*   Have only 1-2 sentences, adhering to one of the
    following two structure:</br>
    *While ..., our research shows that...</br>
    Despite …, we find that…*




!!! tip
    Your pitch won’t be perfect at the first time –
    so practice it over and over again – until you really become enthusiastic about it!
