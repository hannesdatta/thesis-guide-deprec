# Literature Review

!!! note ""
      Elaborate discussion “what do we know”/”not know” and
      contribution (“what do you add to the literature”)

# Wrong Approach
  *  Study A finds 1
  *  Study B finds 2
  *  Study C finds 1
  *  Study D finds 1+2
  *  Study E finds 3
  *  Study F finds 4
  *  My study contributes to the literature by doing x, y,
    and z.


# Correct approach
  * First stream of literature is concerned with 1.
      * Study A supports 1 (+ argument used in study)
      * Study C adds to it (+ argument used in study),
        providing further evidence for 1.
      * **But**, they miss out on x ( -> contribution!)
  * Second stream of literature is concerned with 2.
      * For example, study B and D find 2, while study D
        even supports 1.
      * **But**, they miss out on y ( -> contribution!)
  * Third stream deals with related phenomena.
      * Study E finds 3 (+ why it’s important to your study)
      * Study F finds 4 (+ why it’s important to your study)
      * **But**, they miss out on z ( -> final contribution!)


!!! summary
    Key is to synthesize the literature!



* Most students I talk to enjoy writing their literature review section least.
* So, make it a little more fun by using a few “stock phrases” this will help you to submit a polished draft as opposed to a lousy set of basic sentences.
* As a preview, see this:<br/>

##  Example:

## The Literature Review
  This school of thought....<br/>
  Many recent studies document that...<br/>
  While the link between...and....is not as clearly defined in the literature, it is suggested that....<br/>
  A canvassing of the growing body of literature on... suggests that two schools of thought dominate the extant thinking.<br/>
  Seminal studies include...<br/>

## Showing a Gap in the literature
  Although research on...exists, gaps remain.<br/>
  There is little empirical research...<br/>
  Some questions have been raised in the practitioner literature as to whether....<br/>
  The research has tended to focus on....,rather on.....<br/>

## Replace Long Phrases by Shorter Ones
