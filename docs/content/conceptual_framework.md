# Conceptual Framework

* Have theory of why you expect a relationship between your Xs and Y(s)
    * theory can be based on papers, but also your own logical reasoning, as long as it motivates the         relationship
    * also think about alternative arguments (X could have a positive relationship, but also a negative      relationship)
    * write up your argumentation, then, end with your hypothesis, or spell out your expectation explicitly (you can also admit the relationship can go in two ways)

* Typically, just hypothesizing an effect to exist is weak; it’s much stronger if you can predict its direction
* Draw a conceptual framework (and re draw until it’s perfect)



## Hypothesis Format

* If you have a strong theory, you can cleanly predict what happens to
Y if you change X.
* In that case, it makes most sense having formal hypotheses in your
paper.
* For example, see Datta, Foubert and van Heerde (2015, JMR, [<ins>https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0160</ins>]() )


## Expectations

   * If your theory is not strong, or your predictions are frequently going
       in both ways (e.g., both positive and negative), it’s wiser to not write
       out formal hypotheses but rather expectations.
   * For a paper having expectations, see Datta, Ailawadi , and Van
      Heerde (2017, <ins>[paper here](https://doi.org/10.1509/jm.15.0340)</ins>). Alternatively, a paper can very well do
      without any hypotheses or expectations, see <ins>[spotify](tiu.nu/)</ins>
