# Finding or refining a topic, and carving out your contribution

##  Stage 1

* Find ideas...
    * In academic journals, in practitioner journals, at [**MSI**](http://msi.org/), on the Internet (e.g., McKinsey, Accenture), the news, conversations, talk to managers, own experience, stuff mentioned in this presentation
* Talk to others about your ideas (“Do you find it interesting?”)
* Start writing ideas down
     * writing is not a linear process, first draft doesn’t have to be perfect!!!
* Realize that your ideas will continue to change (even after data collection)… and that’s good!
* Find your focus (narrow down your idea)
* Start thinking about processes and issues instead of topics (!)


##  Stage 2

* Take control and ownership (this takes time!)
* Follow your heart
* Take your time to think
* Read (!!!) related and unrelated stuff you find interesting
* Try to structure your literature and take notes
