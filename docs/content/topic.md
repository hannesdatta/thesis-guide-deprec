# Finding or refining a topic

Alright... You've probably just managed to put together a thesis proposal
(if you are using this for your MSc thesis), or defended your Research Master
thesis (if you're using this to guide you through the first stages of writing
a paper for your PhD). Whatever you're working on, though, chance is that your
**core research idea** - the raison d'etre of this whole project - isn't clear
enough yet. Or, in any case, your advisor may think it isn't clear enough yet.

So how do you make your research idea *better*?

## Get inspired

One good first step is to *let lose a bit* of what you *think* you are
working on at this moment, and seek inspiration.

* in academic journals
    * For example, try to look at the Table of Contents of some of
    the recent issues of [good journals](literature.md). What topics
    are "hot"? What kind of titles do other authors use?
    * Browse the reference list of a few articles you have identified to be relevant
    for your work. What authors do they cite? Do you encounter papers not
    yet part of your reference list? Chance is you haven't even
    identified the core literature for your project yet. *Read broadly*.
    * Pick out a few articles that you like, and that are written in
    good journals. How do authors write their introduction and "pitch" their idea? What do
    they suggest in their sections on "future research" (to be found
    towards the end of a paper)?
* in practitioner journals, blogs, and magazines
    * practitioner journals like Harvard Business Review are a great
    source of inspiration. Less so for the methodological rigor, and more
    so because they're actually widely read in the business community, and are
    hence managerially extremely relevant. Like before, look at the Table
    of Contents to identify "hot" issues, browse some papers, and get inspired.
    * Companies frequently host blogs or publish white papers.
    For technology-oriented topics, see McKinsey, or Accenture.
    * It's also worthwhile to check out corporate blogs and news sites.
* at institutes (e.g., the [Marketing Science Institute](http://msi.org/)
    * The marketing world knows some excellent institutes that aim to bridge
    the gap between marketing academia and marketing practice. For example,
    MSI publishes lists of important research topics an a four-year basis.
    Many academics look at these lists and let them shape their own research
    agendas. Why don't you do the same?
* policy makers

* by talking to friends, or managers
* by considering your own expertise and experience,
* by getting inspired by this guide

## Talk to others about your ideas (“Do you find it interesting?”)

Does your idea "sell"? Making your pitch

## Start writing ideas down
* writing is not a linear process, first draft doesn’t have to be perfect!!!

## Realize that your ideas will continue to change (even after data collection)… and that’s good!

## Find your focus (narrow down your idea)

## Start thinking about processes and issues instead of topics (!)

!!! tip
    [...] some text

    * Take control and ownership (this takes time!)

    * Follow your heart

    * Take your time to think

    * Read (!!!) related and unrelated stuff you find interesting

    * Try to structure your literature and take notes
