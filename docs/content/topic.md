# Finding or refining a topic, and carving out your contribution

## Find ideas...

The first and foremost importance is [...].

* In academic journals,
* in practitioner journals,
* at [**MSI**](http://msi.org/),
* on the Internet (e.g., McKinsey, Accenture, company blogs, news sites),
* by talking to friends, or managers
* by considering your own expertise and experience,
* by getting inspired by this guide

## Talk to others about your ideas (“Do you find it interesting?”)

Does your idea "sell"? Making your pitch

## Start writing ideas down
* writing is not a linear process, first draft doesn’t have to be perfect!!!

## Realize that your ideas will continue to change (even after data collection)… and that’s good!

## Find your focus (narrow down your idea)

## Start thinking about processes and issues instead of topics (!)
