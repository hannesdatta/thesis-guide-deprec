# Master thesis guide

@Hannes, include some text here.

![Overview of process](overview.png)

These website should help you to get started in

- setting up the computing environment on your machine, and
- understanding the basic principles of reproducible science, 

both of which will allow you to manage *data- and computation-intensive projects* way more effeciently than before!

!!! tip 
    * Rather then seeing this page as a one-time exercise, we encourage you to bookmark it and come back to it frequently.
	* Reproducible science is a process - you can start today (e.g., by setting up file structures in a better way), but it will take time to master the more advanced skills.
	* If you find any outdated content, links or unclear descriptions, email us at [h.datta@tilburguniversity.edu]() so that we can update the instructions or clarify as needed.
