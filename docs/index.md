# Managing your Master (and PhD) thesis in Marketing Analytics

!!! warning
	This page is currently under development. Please do not use this material until further notice.

Writing a paper, whether it's for your MSc degree or your PhD, can be
**a challenging experience**. Luckily, you're not the first one to go through
that process. And that's why we have assembled some material to help
you succeed.

We have structured this guide in two main parts: the [**content**](content/index.md) of your paper,
and the [**process**](process/index.md) of writing your paper. Both components
are required to guarantee sufficiently high quality.

Last, you'll find a bunch of tips for [meeting with your advisor](meetings/one.md).

Happy browsing!
