Writing a thesis, whether it's for your MSc degree or your PhD, can be
**a challenging experience**. Luckily, you're not the first one to go through
that process. And that's why we have assembled some material for you to help
you succeed.

The most important things to remember are the two success factors:

![Overview of process](overview.png){: style="height:100px"}


the [**content**](content/index.md) of your thesis + the [**process**](process/index.md) of writing your thesis.
That's why we've structured this manual along these two themes!

Last, you'll find a bunch of tips for [meeting with your advisor](meetings/one.md).

Happy browsing!
